  	 <h3><strong>My Job Search</strong> is your online tool for managing your job search:</h3>

     <h4><ul>
        <li>Keep a database of companies that you are interested in.  Track potential jobs, contacts and overall progress.  See that progress with an easy-to-understand chart.</li>
        <li>Keep track of all the tasks involved in your search: reminders to update documents and social pages, follow-ups with companies and, importantly, tasks about keeping up with your network (coffees, etc).</li>
        <li>At a glance, see how many companies you've added to your search day-by-day.  See what are your most productive days of the week.</li>
